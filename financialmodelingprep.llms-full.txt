What is the source of the company fundamental data for US companies?

Fundamental data is sourced from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) open source website Edgar

What is the time zone for the Intraday endpoint?

In general, the time zone for the endpoints corresponds to the country/region the exchange is located in. For example, stocks traded on the NYSE are on the EST time zone, and stocks traded on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) correspond to the GMT zone.

How long does your data take to populate after a stock reports their earnings?

What is the source of the company fundamental data for non-US companies?

We source International Fundamental data from the exchanges and third-party data providers

Do I need to have separate agreements with the exchanges for real-time data?

Access to real-time or delayed data may be subject to additional agreements with the relevant exchange, and applicable licensing fees may be required. Please contact FMP for additional information or any questions.

## ETF Sector Weighting API
[Home](https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/) [API Documentation](https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs/stable) [ETF Sector Weighting API](https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs/stable/sector-weighting)

# ETF Sector Weighting API

The FMP ETF Sector Weighting API provides a breakdown of the percentage of an ETF's assets that are invested in each sector. For example, an investor may want to invest in an ETF that has a high exposure to the technology sector if they believe that the technology sector is poised for growth.

Explore Endpoint

## About ETF Sector Weighting API

The FMP ETF Sector Allocation API provides crucial information about the distribution of an ETF’s assets across different sectors. This API is particularly useful for investors who want to:

- **Analyze Sector Exposure**: Gain insights into how an ETF’s assets are allocated across sectors, such as technology, healthcare, or consumer staples, to understand its risk profile.
- **Identify Sector-Focused ETFs**: Find ETFs with significant exposure to sectors that align with your investment thesis. For instance, you might choose an ETF with a high allocation to the technology sector if you expect strong growth in that area.
- **Diversify Portfolios**: Use sector weighting data to diversify your portfolio by selecting ETFs that provide exposure to sectors where you might be under-invested, helping to balance overall risk.

For example, an investor who already has significant exposure to technology stocks might seek out an ETF with substantial holdings in healthcare or consumer staples to diversify their investments and mitigate sector-specific risks.

### Dividends Calendar API FAQs

How can I build a detailed dividend yield chart with the same resolution as intraday price charts using your APIs?

You can retrieve the Dividend yield data using the Ratios API for quarter or annual frequency. For more information, you can visit our documentation here: https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs#ratios-statement-analysis

Is your data split adjusted?

Yes, we have historical data adjusted for splits and dividends.

Could you please clarify the difference between the API end points "earnings confirmed" and "earnings calendar"?

The Earning Confirmed endpoint is a list of earnings announcements for publicly traded companies that have already been confirmed and do not return upcoming dates. The Earnings Calendar API is a list of upcoming & past earnings announcements for publicly traded companies, including the date, estimated earnings per share (EPS), and actual EPS (if available) and it's the quarterly schedule and timetable laying out individual release dates of financial reports containing performance data for publicly traded corporations.

For the fields tenYDividendperShareGrowthPerShare, fiveYDividendperShareGrowthPerShare and threeYDividendperShareGrowthPerShare in the Financial Growth API what exactly do these represent? Are they indicative of the growth rate of dividends per share over 10, 5, and 3 years, respectively? Additionally, could you explain how I might derive the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) for dividends per share using these values?

It's just an annual growth rate over 10, 5, or 3 years, you can just use those values directly for the CAGR formula since they are already pre-calculated.

Do you provide S1 filings data?

You can find the S1 filings data in the IPO Calendar endpoint. https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs/#IPO-Calendar

Where can I find historical outstanding shares data for each stock by year?

You can find historical outstanding shares data for each stock by year in the real-time income statement section.

How are historical prices adjusted for splits in your system?

In our End of Day (EOD) API, the 'close' price is adjusted for splits, and the 'adjClose' price is adjusted for both splits and dividends. This adjustment is applied to all symbols in the same manner. You can refer to the API documentation for more details.

### Financial Scores API FAQs

Is the financial scores data provided by the /stable/financial-scores endpoint based on 10-K data or 10-Q data?

The financial scores data provided by the /stable/financial-scores endpoint is based on 6/8-K data until the 10-Q/K data gets released, at which point it overrides the previous data.

What is the source of the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) ratings and scores data?

We source our ESG data from company filings where we apply NLP to extract those keywords: -Social = 'Accident, (Adult AND entertainment), Alcohol, Anti-personnel, Behavior, Charity, (Child AND Labor), Community, Controversial, Controversy, Discrimination, Gambling, Health, Human capital, Human rights, Inclusion, Injury, Labor, Munitions, Opposition, Pay, Philanthropic, Quality, Responsible.' -Environment = 'Biodiversity, Carbon, Cleantech, Clean, Climate, Coal, Conservation, Ecosystem, Emission, Energy, Fuel, Green, Land, Natural, Pollution, (Raw AND materials), Renewable, Resources, Sustainability, Sustainable, Toxic, Waste, Water.' -Governance = 'Advocacy, Bribery, Compensation, Competitive, Corruption, (Data AND breach), Divestment, Fraud, (Global AND Compact), GRI, (Global AND Reporting AND Initiative), Independent, Justice, Stability, Stewardship, Transparency.' Those are the key concepts that we extract from the statements to create the score. We then, with NLP, create the sentiment score to finally create a ranking score. We have developed our methodology based on available frameworks. We also compare each company to the industry benchmark to be able to rank ESG companies compared to their peers. For the bounds of the rating, a score of 0 is the worst and 100 is the best, so a 50 would be average. You can read more here https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs/esg-score-api/

How are companies scored in your company ratings?

Companies are scored based on a quintile ranking within their respective industry and sector. The scoring within the brackets is weighted by the industry and the sector, and split into quintiles based on their relative score.

What is the quality of FMP data?

Quality data is key to making accurate, informed decisions. It is our main focus to deliver the most accurate financial data to our users.

I noticed errors in the financial data for certain companies. How do I report this?

If you notice any errors in the financial data for specific companies, please send an email to info@financialmodelingprep.com with the full details about the issue. Our development team will investigate and address the issue accordingly.

Could you please clarify the difference between the API end points "earnings confirmed" and "earnings calendar"?

The Earning Confirmed endpoint is a list of earnings announcements for publicly traded companies that have already been confirmed and do not return upcoming dates. The Earnings Calendar API is a list of upcoming & past earnings announcements for publicly traded companies, including the date, estimated earnings per share (EPS), and actual EPS (if available) and it's the quarterly schedule and timetable laying out individual release dates of financial reports containing performance data for publicly traded corporations.

How can I determine if earnings data was released before or after markets open from the historical earnings data?

You can determine if earnings data was released before or after markets open by looking at the 'time' field in the earning calendar API. If the 'time' field shows 'BMO' it means the earnings were released before markets open, and if it shows 'AMC' it means the earnings were released after markets close.

### Cash Flow Statement API FAQs

Why the Cash Flow Statement is not updated?

The Cashflow Statements are rarely released with an 8-K (earnings press release) and are only filled after the company releases a 10-Q, 10-K, 20-F etc.

I noticed a discrepancy in the cash flow statement for a specific stock ticker. What should I do?

If you notice any discrepancies in the financial data provided for a specific stock ticker, please reach out to our customer support team with the details. Our team will investigate the issue and work to resolve it as quickly as possible.

How I can query the Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) data for financials statements (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement)?

You use the 'quarterly' financial statements and add the parameter 'limit=4' which will provide data from the last 4 quarters, and then sum the fields for the desired values.

How often is your Financial Statement data is updated?

Typically, we are able to gather financials through an 8-K within 24 hours of an earnings report, However, this data is not as reliable or as full as the data from their 10-Q which takes a bit longer to process.

Why are fields in the income statement 1,000 or 1,000,000 times larger than reported in their SEC filings?

Firstly, check if the financial statements are denominated in thousands or millions in their SEC statement. If this is not the case it is likely that our pull from the SEC is not denominated properly, which can affect just the shares outstanding (and diluted), or the entire statement. If you run into a rare instance of this please reach out to us here and we can get it fixed for you in a timely manner.

I noticed a discrepancy in the financial statements for a stock. How should I report this issue?

To report a discrepancy in the financial statements for a specific stock, please submit a bug ticket through our chatbot. Make sure to provide all the requested information to help us investigate and resolve the issue promptly.

How do I retrieve quarterly financial data information on Excel?

Please review our Excel documentation. The specific query in this case is : =Financial Modeling Prep.INCOMESTATEMENT('AAPL';10;'quarter')
=Financial Modeling Prep.INCOMESTATEMENT(symbol;\[limit\];\[datatype\];\[headers\];\[interval\])

### ESG Ratings API FAQs

What are the basis for ESG Risk Ratings provided by your company?

Our ESG Risk Ratings are based on a comprehensive analysis of environmental, social, and governance factors that impact a company's sustainability and ethical practices. These factors are evaluated using a combination of qualitative and quantitative data to provide a holistic view of a company's ESG performance.

What is the source of the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) ratings and scores data?

We source our ESG data from company filings where we apply NLP to extract those keywords: -Social = 'Accident, (Adult AND entertainment), Alcohol, Anti-personnel, Behavior, Charity, (Child AND Labor), Community, Controversial, Controversy, Discrimination, Gambling, Health, Human capital, Human rights, Inclusion, Injury, Labor, Munitions, Opposition, Pay, Philanthropic, Quality, Responsible.' -Environment = 'Biodiversity, Carbon, Cleantech, Clean, Climate, Coal, Conservation, Ecosystem, Emission, Energy, Fuel, Green, Land, Natural, Pollution, (Raw AND materials), Renewable, Resources, Sustainability, Sustainable, Toxic, Waste, Water.' -Governance = 'Advocacy, Bribery, Compensation, Competitive, Corruption, (Data AND breach), Divestment, Fraud, (Global AND Compact), GRI, (Global AND Reporting AND Initiative), Independent, Justice, Stability, Stewardship, Transparency.' Those are the key concepts that we extract from the statements to create the score. We then, with NLP, create the sentiment score to finally create a ranking score. We have developed our methodology based on available frameworks. We also compare each company to the industry benchmark to be able to rank ESG companies compared to their peers. For the bounds of the rating, a score of 0 is the worst and 100 is the best, so a 50 would be average. You can read more here https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs/esg-score-api/

What analyst firms do you support and cover?

Here is a list of Analyst rating Firms we provide coverage for: Alliance Global Partners, Analyst Company, Arete Research, Argus Research, Ascendiant, Atlantic Equities, Autonomous Research, B.Riley Financial, Banco Santander, Bank of America Securities, Barclays, Barrington, Benchmark Co., Berenberg Bank, Bernstein, BlackRock, BMO Capital, BNP Paribas, BOCOM International Holdings Company, Boenning & Scattergood, Bradesco, Bryan Garnier & Co Ltd, BTG Pactual, BTIG, C.L.

How are companies scored in your company ratings?

Companies are scored based on a quintile ranking within their respective industry and sector. The scoring within the brackets is weighted by the industry and the sector, and split into quintiles based on their relative score.

How are sentiment scores computed for the Stock News Sentiments RSS Feed API?

The sentiment scores for the Stock News Sentiments RSS Feed API are computed based on the number of positive and negative/neutral comments received in a 24-hour period. For example, if there are 500 positive comments and 500 negative/neutral comments, the sentiment score would be calculated as (500 \* 1) + (500 \* 0) = 500. The average mentions per day value would then be 500 / 1000 = 0.5. Additionally, the Average Hype Index (AHI) and Relative Hype Index (RHI) are calculated to provide further insights into sentiment.

Is the financial scores data provided by the /stable/financial-scores endpoint based on 10-K data or 10-Q data?

The financial scores data provided by the /stable/financial-scores endpoint is based on 6/8-K data until the 10-Q/K data gets released, at which point it overrides the previous data.

What is the source of the company fundamental data for US companies?

Fundamental data is sourced from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) open source website Edgar

### Dividends Company API FAQs

Is your data split adjusted?

How can I build a detailed dividend yield chart with the same resolution as intraday price charts using your APIs?

You can retrieve the Dividend yield data using the Ratios API for quarter or annual frequency. For more information, you can visit our documentation here: https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs#ratios-statement-analysis

If you notice any discrepancies in the financial data provided for a specific stock ticker, please reach out to our customer support team with the details. Our team will investigate the issue and work to resolve it as quickly as possible.

For the fields tenYDividendperShareGrowthPerShare, fiveYDividendperShareGrowthPerShare and threeYDividendperShareGrowthPerShare in the Financial Growth API what exactly do these represent? Are they indicative of the growth rate of dividends per share over 10, 5, and 3 years, respectively? Additionally, could you explain how I might derive the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) for dividends per share using these values?

It's just an annual growth rate over 10, 5, or 3 years, you can just use those values directly for the CAGR formula since they are already pre-calculated.

Where can I find historical outstanding shares data for each stock by year?

You can find historical outstanding shares data for each stock by year in the real-time income statement section.

Where do you source data for 'numberOfShares' in terms of 'ownership structure'?

The Number of shares outstanding is sourced from quarterly and annual filings.

### Financial Scores Bulk API FAQs

Do you have bulk endpoints where I can easily access multiple companies' financial statements?

Yes you can access our Bach and Bulk endpoints where you will access companies financial statements in bulk. For the quote endpoint you can also call the API with multiple tickers separated via a comma.

What would you suggest the sleep time between 2 api calls to these bulk endpoints?

You can hit the bulk endpoints Once / 10 seconds and the Profile Bulk / ETF Bulk - Once / 60 seconds.

What is the source of the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) ratings and scores data?

We source our ESG data from company filings where we apply NLP to extract those keywords: -Social = 'Accident, (Adult AND entertainment), Alcohol, Anti-personnel, Behavior, Charity, (Child AND Labor), Community, Controversial, Controversy, Discrimination, Gambling, Health, Human capital, Human rights, Inclusion, Injury, Labor, Munitions, Opposition, Pay, Philanthropic, Quality, Responsible.' -Environment = 'Biodiversity, Carbon, Cleantech, Clean, Climate, Coal, Conservation, Ecosystem, Emission, Energy, Fuel, Green, Land, Natural, Pollution, (Raw AND materials), Renewable, Resources, Sustainability, Sustainable, Toxic, Waste, Water.' -Governance = 'Advocacy, Bribery, Compensation, Competitive, Corruption, (Data AND breach), Divestment, Fraud, (Global AND Compact), GRI, (Global AND Reporting AND Initiative), Independent, Justice, Stability, Stewardship, Transparency.' Those are the key concepts that we extract from the statements to create the score. We then, with NLP, create the sentiment score to finally create a ranking score. We have developed our methodology based on available frameworks. We also compare each company to the industry benchmark to be able to rank ESG companies compared to their peers. For the bounds of the rating, a score of 0 is the worst and 100 is the best, so a 50 would be average. You can read more here https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs/esg-score-api/

Is the financial scores data provided by the /stable/financial-scores endpoint based on 10-K data or 10-Q data?

The financial scores data provided by the /stable/financial-scores endpoint is based on 6/8-K data until the 10-Q/K data gets released, at which point it overrides the previous data.

How can I retrieve historical bulk key-metrics for a period spanning multiple years?

At the moment, it is not possible to retrieve historical bulk key-metrics for a period spanning multiple years in one batch. You can specify the year and period for annual or quarterly data using the Bulk Key Metrics API.

Do you offer a bulk API endpoint for the institutional-ownership/symbol-positions-summary?

At the moment, we do not have a bulk API for the institutional-ownership/symbol-positions-summary endpoint.

How are sentiment scores computed for the Stock News Sentiments RSS Feed API?

The sentiment scores for the Stock News Sentiments RSS Feed API are computed based on the number of positive and negative/neutral comments received in a 24-hour period. For example, if there are 500 positive comments and 500 negative/neutral comments, the sentiment score would be calculated as (500 \* 1) + (500 \* 0) = 500. The average mentions per day value would then be 500 / 1000 = 0.5. Additionally, the Average Hype Index (AHI) and Relative Hype Index (RHI) are calculated to provide further insights into sentiment.

### Financial Estimates API FAQs

What is the source of the Analyst Estimates data?

We have multiple estimates, such as Davit Kirakosyan, who has been working for us for a few months, and we aggregate the analyst reports from the news to aggregate them. We are using estimates from the news that we extract for the growth rate and have an algorithm for smaller cap stocks, that uses the CAGR formula with a rolling period of 5 years. We are also working on extracting the estimate from the press release and Wall Street analysts to have a consensus estimate, which will be available soon. We also have Wall Street Analyst estimates: https://financialmodelingprep.com/api/v4/earning-estimate?page=0&apikey=your\_api\_key

Does the 'Analyst Estimates API' provide estimates in the currency of the company or in dollars?

The analyst estimates currency is the same as the financial statement.

How can I determine the currency in which the earnings estimates are provided in the FMP.ANALYSTESTIMATES function?

The currency for our financial data is dependent on how the company reported its financial reports. You can cross-reference the currency by checking the company's financial statements or reports to determine the currency in which the earnings estimates are provided.

Do you offer a deeper history of financial data beyond the 4-year income statements available for free users?

Yes, we do offer a deeper history of financial data beyond the 4-year income statements available for free users. For more information on the depth of historical data available and which subscription plan provides access to it, please contact our sales team using the following link: https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/enterprise-contact

I noticed errors in the financial data for certain companies. How do I report this?

If you notice any errors in the financial data for specific companies, please send an email to info@financialmodelingprep.com with the full details about the issue. Our development team will investigate and address the issue accordingly.

Does Financial Modeling Prep currently have bond data?

Unfortunately we currently do not provide bond data but are planning in implementing this in the near future. If you would like a custom solution, please reach out to sales@financialmodelingprep.com

How do I retrieve quarterly financial data information on Excel?

Please review our Excel documentation. The specific query in this case is : =Financial Modeling Prep.INCOMESTATEMENT('AAPL';10;'quarter')
=Financial Modeling Prep.INCOMESTATEMENT(symbol;\[limit\];\[datatype\];\[headers\];\[interval\])

### Institutional Ownership Filings API FAQs

What type of data is included in the 'Advanced Data' and 'Corporate Filings' packages that isn't in the starter package?

The 'Advanced Data' package includes more detailed financial data such as historical stock prices, financial ratios, and analyst recommendations. The 'Corporate Filings' package includes access to SEC filings, annual reports, and other regulatory documents filed by public companies.

Do you provide S1 filings data?

You can find the S1 filings data in the IPO Calendar endpoint. https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs/#IPO-Calendar

Why does the filing date match the date?

The filing date field is populated from the SEC, as a result, international stocks do not pull in data for the filing date and thus are mapped to the date.

How can I access filing links for International stocks such as India, China, etc?

You can access filing links for International stocks by checking the final links field in our financial endpoints. Please refer to our documentation at https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs#income-statements-financial-statements for more information.

What is the average latency from the filing (insider or 13f) appearing on SEC Edgar to being available through your APIs?

The initial extraction of data from when it gets filed to being available through our APIs should be under a few hours. However, the full holding analytics can take up to 48 hours as all the holdings previously would need to be recalculated.

How often is your Financial Statement data is updated?

Typically, we are able to gather financials through an 8-K within 24 hours of an earnings report, However, this data is not as reliable or as full as the data from their 10-Q which takes a bit longer to process.

How can I download the full text of SEC filings using the API?

You can download the full text of SEC filings using our API by accessing the following link: https://financialmodelingprep.com/api/v3/sec\_filings/AAPL?type=10-k&page=0&apikey=YOUR-API-KEY

- **Informed Investment Decisions**: With a levered DCF approach, investors can make better decisions by understanding the impact of financial obligations on a company's value.

This API is essential for performing deeper financial analysis and gaining a holistic view of a company’s valuation.

**Example Use Case**

An investor evaluating whether to buy Apple shares can use the Levered DCF API to compare the company's DCF value to its current stock price. If the DCF is significantly lower than the market price, the investor might reconsider the purchase, factoring in the company’s debt obligations.

### Batch Market Cap API FAQs

Can I retrieve the 15 largest market cap stocks for each sector using the company-screener endpoint?

Currently, you can add the market cap parameter to the company-screener endpoint to filter stocks based on a specific market cap value, but the data will not be returned in sorted order from largest to smallest.

Yes, the Starter plan for $29 allows you access to market cap data for European stocks.

Does the FMP.HISTORICALMARKETCAPITALIZATION formula have an 'interval' parameter?

You use the 'quarterly' financial statements and add the parameter 'limit=4' which will provide data from the last 4 quarters, and then sum the fields for the desired values.

How do I get the industry information of tickers?

You can get this information on the Profile API: https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs#company-profile-company-information

How can I build a detailed dividend yield chart with the same resolution as intraday price charts using your APIs?

You can retrieve the Dividend yield data using the Ratios API for quarter or annual frequency. For more information, you can visit our documentation here: https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs#ratios-statement-analysis

I noticed a discrepancy in the cash flow statement for a specific stock ticker. What should I do?

If you notice any discrepancies in the financial data provided for a specific stock ticker, please reach out to our customer support team with the details. Our team will investigate the issue and work to resolve it as quickly as possible.

How are sentiment scores computed for the Stock News Sentiments RSS Feed API?

The sentiment scores for the Stock News Sentiments RSS Feed API are computed based on the number of positive and negative/neutral comments received in a 24-hour period. For example, if there are 500 positive comments and 500 negative/neutral comments, the sentiment score would be calculated as (500 \* 1) + (500 \* 0) = 500. The average mentions per day value would then be 500 / 1000 = 0.5. Additionally, the Average Hype Index (AHI) and Relative Hype Index (RHI) are calculated to provide further insights into sentiment.

How can I retrieve the tickers included in an index using your API?

To retrieve the tickers included in an index using our API, you can make a request to the following endpoint: https://financialmodelingprep.com/stable/etf-holder-bulk. This will provide you with the information you are looking for.

What is the source of the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) ratings and scores data?

We source our ESG data from company filings where we apply NLP to extract those keywords: -Social = 'Accident, (Adult AND entertainment), Alcohol, Anti-personnel, Behavior, Charity, (Child AND Labor), Community, Controversial, Controversy, Discrimination, Gambling, Health, Human capital, Human rights, Inclusion, Injury, Labor, Munitions, Opposition, Pay, Philanthropic, Quality, Responsible.' -Environment = 'Biodiversity, Carbon, Cleantech, Clean, Climate, Coal, Conservation, Ecosystem, Emission, Energy, Fuel, Green, Land, Natural, Pollution, (Raw AND materials), Renewable, Resources, Sustainability, Sustainable, Toxic, Waste, Water.' -Governance = 'Advocacy, Bribery, Compensation, Competitive, Corruption, (Data AND breach), Divestment, Fraud, (Global AND Compact), GRI, (Global AND Reporting AND Initiative), Independent, Justice, Stability, Stewardship, Transparency.' Those are the key concepts that we extract from the statements to create the score. We then, with NLP, create the sentiment score to finally create a ranking score. We have developed our methodology based on available frameworks. We also compare each company to the industry benchmark to be able to rank ESG companies compared to their peers. For the bounds of the rating, a score of 0 is the worst and 100 is the best, so a 50 would be average. You can read more here https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs/esg-score-api/

### Income Statements TTM API FAQs

How I can query the Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) data for financials statements (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement)?

You use the 'quarterly' financial statements and add the parameter 'limit=4' which will provide data from the last 4 quarters, and then sum the fields for the desired values.

How do I get the industry information of tickers?

You can get this information on the Profile API: https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs#company-profile-company-information

I noticed a discrepancy in the cash flow statement for a specific stock ticker. What should I do?

If you notice any discrepancies in the financial data provided for a specific stock ticker, please reach out to our customer support team with the details. Our team will investigate the issue and work to resolve it as quickly as possible.

How often is your Financial Statement data is updated?

Typically, we are able to gather financials through an 8-K within 24 hours of an earnings report, However, this data is not as reliable or as full as the data from their 10-Q which takes a bit longer to process.

How do I retrieve quarterly financial data information on Excel?

Please review our Excel documentation. The specific query in this case is : =Financial Modeling Prep.INCOMESTATEMENT('AAPL';10;'quarter')
=Financial Modeling Prep.INCOMESTATEMENT(symbol;\[limit\];\[datatype\];\[headers\];\[interval\])

Why are fields in the income statement 1,000 or 1,000,000 times larger than reported in their SEC filings?

Firstly, check if the financial statements are denominated in thousands or millions in their SEC statement. If this is not the case it is likely that our pull from the SEC is not denominated properly, which can affect just the shares outstanding (and diluted), or the entire statement. If you run into a rare instance of this please reach out to us here and we can get it fixed for you in a timely manner.

Why the Cash Flow Statement is not updated?

The Cashflow Statements are rarely released with an 8-K (earnings press release) and are only filled after the company releases a 10-Q, 10-K, 20-F etc.

### Earnings Transcript List API FAQs

What is the FMP Earnings Transcript coverage?

We currently cover transcripts for US stocks.

Which plan includes the earnings call transcripts API?

To access the earnings call transcripts API, you will need at least the Premium plan.

What is the FMP Earning Transcripts data source?

We have multiple data sources for Earnings Transcript data. Sometimes the data is available from the SEC, but it is mostly through company websites or our third party data providers. We have multiple sources where we get access to the earnings call transcript: One source is we use the SEC website to access the available transcripts as an example and when not available, we get them from their investor relations website as in example here . In addition, we have our analysts listen in to the call and have developed apps to transcribe the call and lastly, we have partnership with various data vendors to fill out gaps when needed

Could you please clarify the difference between the API end points "earnings confirmed" and "earnings calendar"?

The Earning Confirmed endpoint is a list of earnings announcements for publicly traded companies that have already been confirmed and do not return upcoming dates. The Earnings Calendar API is a list of upcoming & past earnings announcements for publicly traded companies, including the date, estimated earnings per share (EPS), and actual EPS (if available) and it's the quarterly schedule and timetable laying out individual release dates of financial reports containing performance data for publicly traded corporations.

How can I determine the currency in which the earnings estimates are provided in the FMP.ANALYSTESTIMATES function?

The currency for our financial data is dependent on how the company reported its financial reports. You can cross-reference the currency by checking the company's financial statements or reports to determine the currency in which the earnings estimates are provided.

How long does your data take to populate after a stock reports their earnings?

Typically, we are able to gather financials through an 8-K within 24 hours of an earnings report, However, this data is not as reliable or as full as the data from their 10-Q which takes a bit longer to process.

How can I determine if earnings data was released before or after markets open from the historical earnings data?

You can determine if earnings data was released before or after markets open by looking at the 'time' field in the earning calendar API. If the 'time' field shows 'BMO' it means the earnings were released before markets open, and if it shows 'AMC' it means the earnings were released after markets close.

### 1 Min Interval Stock Chart API FAQs

How can I retrieve historical intraday price data for more than 1 month?

To retrieve historical intraday price data for more than 1 month, you will need to implement a loop that iterates over day intervals covering the entire desired time range. This approach ensures a suitable response speed for the data being returned. For example, if you require more than 1 month of 30-minute data, you can make queries over day intervals to cover the entire desired time range. Here is an example link for retrieving 1-minute data: https://financialmodelingprep.com/api/v3/historical-chart/1min/AAPL?from=2024-12-04&to=2024-12-06&apikey=YOUR-API-KEY

Is the Intraday price adjusted?

Yes, the intraday data is adjusted for split.

Can the 1-minute interval stock price API provide data accurate to minute level?

Yes, the 1-minute interval stock price API can provide data accurate to minute level. You can specify the time in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM for minute-level data.

How many years of intraday data I can get in one query?

Due to the sheer size and volume of the historical intraday price data there are limits to the number of records that can be returned in a given query. Contact our support team for more information.

How can I get unadjusted 1min price data using the Financial Modeling Prep API?

To get unadjusted 1min price data using the Financial Modeling Prep API, you can add the parameter 'nonadjusted=true' to the URL of the historical chart endpoint. This will provide you with the data without any reverse stock split adjustments.

I tried to get 1-minute historical data by setting the 'from' and 'to' dates to a period before 2022, but only an empty list is returned. What could be the issue?

When querying historical intraday price data, there are limits to the number of records that can be returned in a given query. If you need data from a period before 2022, you will need to implement a loop that iterates over day intervals covering the entire desired time range. This will ensure a suitable response speed for the data being returned.

Does the intraday historical market cover pre-market and after hours?

Yes, the historical market data for pre-market and post-market data can be found here https://financialmodelingprep.com/api/v4/historical-price/AAPL/1/minute/2021-06-11/2021-06-11?apikey=your\_api\_key or https://financialmodelingprep.com/api/v3/historical-chart/1min/AAPL?from=2021-06-11&to=2021-06-11&extended=true&apikey=your\_api\_key

### Latest Financial Statements API FAQs

How often is your Financial Statement data is updated?

Typically, we are able to gather financials through an 8-K within 24 hours of an earnings report, However, this data is not as reliable or as full as the data from their 10-Q which takes a bit longer to process.

How I can query the Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) data for financials statements (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement)?

You use the 'quarterly' financial statements and add the parameter 'limit=4' which will provide data from the last 4 quarters, and then sum the fields for the desired values.

Why the Cash Flow Statement is not updated?

The Cashflow Statements are rarely released with an 8-K (earnings press release) and are only filled after the company releases a 10-Q, 10-K, 20-F etc.

Is the financial scores data provided by the /stable/financial-scores endpoint based on 10-K data or 10-Q data?

The financial scores data provided by the /stable/financial-scores endpoint is based on 6/8-K data until the 10-Q/K data gets released, at which point it overrides the previous data.

How long does it take for the quarterly financial statements to be updated in the API after they are released by the companies?

The financial statements are updated in the API 24-48 hours after the data is released by the company.

How do I retrieve quarterly financial data information on Excel?

Please review our Excel documentation. The specific query in this case is : =Financial Modeling Prep.INCOMESTATEMENT('AAPL';10;'quarter')
=Financial Modeling Prep.INCOMESTATEMENT(symbol;\[limit\];\[datatype\];\[headers\];\[interval\])

Do you offer a deeper history of financial data beyond the 4-year income statements available for free users?

Yes, we do offer a deeper history of financial data beyond the 4-year income statements available for free users. For more information on the depth of historical data available and which subscription plan provides access to it, please contact our sales team using the following link: https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/enterprise-contact

### Income Statement Growth API FAQs

Does the ten year, five year, three year growth rates represent the total growth rate over that period or the average annual growth rate?

The growth rates represent the total growth rate over the specified period.

Why are fields in the income statement 1,000 or 1,000,000 times larger than reported in their SEC filings?

Firstly, check if the financial statements are denominated in thousands or millions in their SEC statement. If this is not the case it is likely that our pull from the SEC is not denominated properly, which can affect just the shares outstanding (and diluted), or the entire statement. If you run into a rare instance of this please reach out to us here and we can get it fixed for you in a timely manner.

Do you offer a deeper history of financial data beyond the 4-year income statements available for free users?

Yes, we do offer a deeper history of financial data beyond the 4-year income statements available for free users. For more information on the depth of historical data available and which subscription plan provides access to it, please contact our sales team using the following link: https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/enterprise-contact

For the fields tenYDividendperShareGrowthPerShare, fiveYDividendperShareGrowthPerShare and threeYDividendperShareGrowthPerShare in the Financial Growth API what exactly do these represent? Are they indicative of the growth rate of dividends per share over 10, 5, and 3 years, respectively? Additionally, could you explain how I might derive the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) for dividends per share using these values?

It's just an annual growth rate over 10, 5, or 3 years, you can just use those values directly for the CAGR formula since they are already pre-calculated.

How I can query the Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) data for financials statements (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement)?

You use the 'quarterly' financial statements and add the parameter 'limit=4' which will provide data from the last 4 quarters, and then sum the fields for the desired values.

Why the Cash Flow Statement is not updated?

The Cashflow Statements are rarely released with an 8-K (earnings press release) and are only filled after the company releases a 10-Q, 10-K, 20-F etc.

How often is your Financial Statement data is updated?

Typically, we are able to gather financials through an 8-K within 24 hours of an earnings report, However, this data is not as reliable or as full as the data from their 10-Q which takes a bit longer to process.

### Balance Sheet Data API FAQs

Why the Cash Flow Statement is not updated?

The Cashflow Statements are rarely released with an 8-K (earnings press release) and are only filled after the company releases a 10-Q, 10-K, 20-F etc.

I noticed a discrepancy in the cash flow statement for a specific stock ticker. What should I do?

If you notice any discrepancies in the financial data provided for a specific stock ticker, please reach out to our customer support team with the details. Our team will investigate the issue and work to resolve it as quickly as possible.

Why are fields in the income statement 1,000 or 1,000,000 times larger than reported in their SEC filings?

Firstly, check if the financial statements are denominated in thousands or millions in their SEC statement. If this is not the case it is likely that our pull from the SEC is not denominated properly, which can affect just the shares outstanding (and diluted), or the entire statement. If you run into a rare instance of this please reach out to us here and we can get it fixed for you in a timely manner.

How I can query the Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) data for financials statements (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement)?

You use the 'quarterly' financial statements and add the parameter 'limit=4' which will provide data from the last 4 quarters, and then sum the fields for the desired values.

How often is your Financial Statement data is updated?

Typically, we are able to gather financials through an 8-K within 24 hours of an earnings report, However, this data is not as reliable or as full as the data from their 10-Q which takes a bit longer to process.

How is the graham net-net value calculated?

The graham net-net value is calculated using the formula: grahamNetNet = (balanceSheet.cashAndCashEquivalents + balanceSheet.shortTermInvestments + (0.75 \* balanceSheet.netReceivables) + (0.5 \* balanceSheet.inventory) - balanceSheet.totalLiabilities) / shares.

I noticed a discrepancy in the financial statements for a stock. How should I report this issue?

To report a discrepancy in the financial statements for a specific stock, please submit a bug ticket through our chatbot. Make sure to provide all the requested information to help us investigate and resolve the issue promptly.

### Holder Performance Summary API FAQs

How does the API calculate sector performance?

The API calculates sector performance by taking the average change percentage of all the companies within that sector. The change percentage can be found on the quote endpoint, while the sector information can be found on the profile endpoint.

Is the financial scores data provided by the /stable/financial-scores endpoint based on 10-K data or 10-Q data?

The financial scores data provided by the /stable/financial-scores endpoint is based on 6/8-K data until the 10-Q/K data gets released, at which point it overrides the previous data.

What is the source of the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) ratings and scores data?

We source our ESG data from company filings where we apply NLP to extract those keywords: -Social = 'Accident, (Adult AND entertainment), Alcohol, Anti-personnel, Behavior, Charity, (Child AND Labor), Community, Controversial, Controversy, Discrimination, Gambling, Health, Human capital, Human rights, Inclusion, Injury, Labor, Munitions, Opposition, Pay, Philanthropic, Quality, Responsible.' -Environment = 'Biodiversity, Carbon, Cleantech, Clean, Climate, Coal, Conservation, Ecosystem, Emission, Energy, Fuel, Green, Land, Natural, Pollution, (Raw AND materials), Renewable, Resources, Sustainability, Sustainable, Toxic, Waste, Water.' -Governance = 'Advocacy, Bribery, Compensation, Competitive, Corruption, (Data AND breach), Divestment, Fraud, (Global AND Compact), GRI, (Global AND Reporting AND Initiative), Independent, Justice, Stability, Stewardship, Transparency.' Those are the key concepts that we extract from the statements to create the score. We then, with NLP, create the sentiment score to finally create a ranking score. We have developed our methodology based on available frameworks. We also compare each company to the industry benchmark to be able to rank ESG companies compared to their peers. For the bounds of the rating, a score of 0 is the worst and 100 is the best, so a 50 would be average. You can read more here https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs/esg-score-api/

What are the basis for ESG Risk Ratings provided by your company?

Our ESG Risk Ratings are based on a comprehensive analysis of environmental, social, and governance factors that impact a company's sustainability and ethical practices. These factors are evaluated using a combination of qualitative and quantitative data to provide a holistic view of a company's ESG performance.

Where can I find historical outstanding shares data for each stock by year?

You can find historical outstanding shares data for each stock by year in the real-time income statement section.

Where do you source data for 'numberOfShares' in terms of 'ownership structure'?

The Number of shares outstanding is sourced from quarterly and annual filings.

How are sentiment scores computed for the Stock News Sentiments RSS Feed API?

The sentiment scores for the Stock News Sentiments RSS Feed API are computed based on the number of positive and negative/neutral comments received in a 24-hour period. For example, if there are 500 positive comments and 500 negative/neutral comments, the sentiment score would be calculated as (500 \* 1) + (500 \* 0) = 500. The average mentions per day value would then be 500 / 1000 = 0.5. Additionally, the Average Hype Index (AHI) and Relative Hype Index (RHI) are calculated to provide further insights into sentiment.

What type of data is included in the 'Advanced Data' and 'Corporate Filings' packages that isn't in the starter package?

The 'Advanced Data' package includes more detailed financial data such as historical stock prices, financial ratios, and analyst recommendations. The 'Corporate Filings' package includes access to SEC filings, annual reports, and other regulatory documents filed by public companies.

How do you calculate shares float?

The Shares Float data is extracted from the 10-Q 10-K, 6-K, 8-K, 20-K, and 40-F. They are also adjusted for insider shares via proxy statements.

I noticed a discrepancy in the financial statements for a stock. How should I report this issue?

To report a discrepancy in the financial statements for a specific stock, please submit a bug ticket through our chatbot. Make sure to provide all the requested information to help us investigate and resolve the issue promptly.

What is the source of the company fundamental data for US companies?

Fundamental data is sourced from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) open source website Edgar

Do you provide country and regions exposure for bonds at a fund level?

At the moment, we do not provide bonds data. However, for fund level data regarding region or country exposures, along with historical prices, we do offer ETF fund and country allocation data. If you are interested in commercial use of our data, please submit your information using the following link: https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/enterprise-contact

What is the FMP Earnings Transcript coverage?

We currently cover transcripts for US stocks.

Why are fields in the income statement 1,000 or 1,000,000 times larger than reported in their SEC filings?

Firstly, check if the financial statements are denominated in thousands or millions in their SEC statement. If this is not the case it is likely that our pull from the SEC is not denominated properly, which can affect just the shares outstanding (and diluted), or the entire statement. If you run into a rare instance of this please reach out to us here and we can get it fixed for you in a timely manner.

### Price Target News API FAQs

Where does Financial Modeling Prep source news from?

Financial Modeling Prep works with several data providers to source and provide financial and market news

How can I retrieve the 12-month price target and Year-to-Date data for a stock using your API?

You can use the Price Target endpoint to retrieve historical data for a ticker, including the 12-month price target and Year-to-Date information. Our data includes Historical Price Target data starting from 2021.

How frequently does your company check news sources for new articles?

We check every news page every hour for any new articles. This ensures that we do not miss any news from the sources that we have.

What is the source of the Analyst Estimates data?

We have multiple estimates, such as Davit Kirakosyan, who has been working for us for a few months, and we aggregate the analyst reports from the news to aggregate them. We are using estimates from the news that we extract for the growth rate and have an algorithm for smaller cap stocks, that uses the CAGR formula with a rolling period of 5 years. We are also working on extracting the estimate from the press release and Wall Street analysts to have a consensus estimate, which will be available soon. We also have Wall Street Analyst estimates: https://financialmodelingprep.com/api/v4/earning-estimate?page=0&apikey=your\_api\_key

How far back does the news data go?

The news data goes back to 2019.

I can't find the full historical prices endpoint for stocks anymore. Can you help me locate it?

Sure, you can find the historical prices endpoint for stocks at this URL: "https://financialmodelingprep.com/api/v3/historical-price-full/AAPL?apikey=YOUR\_API\_KEY." You can refer to the documentation here: "https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs#daily-chart-charts" for more details.

How are sentiment scores computed for the Stock News Sentiments RSS Feed API?

The sentiment scores for the Stock News Sentiments RSS Feed API are computed based on the number of positive and negative/neutral comments received in a 24-hour period. For example, if there are 500 positive comments and 500 negative/neutral comments, the sentiment score would be calculated as (500 \* 1) + (500 \* 0) = 500. The average mentions per day value would then be 500 / 1000 = 0.5. Additionally, the Average Hype Index (AHI) and Relative Hype Index (RHI) are calculated to provide further insights into sentiment.

### Related Relative Strength Index APIs

### Relative Strength Index API FAQs

How are sentiment scores computed for the Stock News Sentiments RSS Feed API?

The sentiment scores for the Stock News Sentiments RSS Feed API are computed based on the number of positive and negative/neutral comments received in a 24-hour period. For example, if there are 500 positive comments and 500 negative/neutral comments, the sentiment score would be calculated as (500 \* 1) + (500 \* 0) = 500. The average mentions per day value would then be 500 / 1000 = 0.5. Additionally, the Average Hype Index (AHI) and Relative Hype Index (RHI) are calculated to provide further insights into sentiment.

How many years of data do you cover?

We cover more than 30+ years for most of our endpoints if the information is available on company filings.

How many stocks do you provide financial data for?

We have over 80,000 unique symbols that we provide financial data for across 60 stock exchanges globally

What is the quality of FMP data?

Quality data is key to making accurate, informed decisions. It is our main focus to deliver the most accurate financial data to our users.

Is your data split adjusted?

Yes, we have historical data adjusted for splits and dividends.

How can I see new endpoints added to the API?

We keep track of all changes including new properties and new endpoints added to our API on our changelog.

How long does your data take to populate after a stock reports their earnings?

Typically, we are able to gather financials through an 8-K within 24 hours of an earnings report, However, this data is not as reliable or as full as the data from their 10-Q which takes a bit longer to process.

- **Analyzing Asset Exposure**: Use the data to analyze the exposure of specific assets within ETFs, helping you understand how widely a stock is held and its significance within different funds.

How many years of intraday data I can get in one query?

Due to the sheer size and volume of the historical intraday price data there are limits to the number of records that can be returned in a given query. Contact our support team for more information.

What is the time zone for the Intraday endpoint?

In general, the time zone for the endpoints corresponds to the country/region the exchange is located in. For example, stocks traded on the NYSE are on the EST time zone, and stocks traded on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) correspond to the GMT zone.

How can I request one particular minute's bar data?

You can use the Intraday chart API endpoint with the specific date and stock symbol to request one particular minute's bar data. For example, you can use the following URL format: https://financialmodelingprep.com/api/v3/historical-chart/1min/AAPL?from=2025-02-28&to=2025-02-28&apikey=YOUR-API-KEY

### Revenue Product Segmentation API FAQs

Why does the net income field deviate from a companies bottom-line net income?

Most of the time the net income will reflect the bottom line net income, however, if a company has unusual items that they subtract from their net income they are not accounted for in our net income. The bottom line net income is utilized in the calculation of EPS and EPS diluted though.

Why does the filing date match the date?

The filing date field is populated from the SEC, as a result, international stocks do not pull in data for the filing date and thus are mapped to the date.

Why are fields in the income statement 1,000 or 1,000,000 times larger than reported in their SEC filings?

Firstly, check if the financial statements are denominated in thousands or millions in their SEC statement. If this is not the case it is likely that our pull from the SEC is not denominated properly, which can affect just the shares outstanding (and diluted), or the entire statement. If you run into a rare instance of this please reach out to us here and we can get it fixed for you in a timely manner.

How can I build a detailed dividend yield chart with the same resolution as intraday price charts using your APIs?

You can retrieve the Dividend yield data using the Ratios API for quarter or annual frequency. For more information, you can visit our documentation here: https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs#ratios-statement-analysis

How many years of data do you cover?

We cover more than 30+ years for most of our endpoints if the information is available on company filings.

How many stocks do you provide financial data for?

We have over 80,000 unique symbols that we provide financial data for across 60 stock exchanges globally

Quality data is key to making accurate, informed decisions. It is our main focus to deliver the most accurate financial data to our users.
